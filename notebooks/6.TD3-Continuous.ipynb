    "### TD3 - Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient\n",
    "\n",
    "The Q-learning algorithm is commonly known to suffer from the overestimation of the value function. This overestimation can propagate through the training iterations and negatively affect the policy. This property directly motivated [Double Q-learning](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/3964-double-q-learning) and [Double DQN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06461): the action selection and Q-value update are decoupled by using two value networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic** (short for **TD3**; Fujimoto et al., 2018) applied a couple of tricks on DDPG to prevent the overestimation of the value function:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Clipped Double Q-learning** \n",
    "\n",
    "In Double Q-Learning, the action selection and Q-value estimation are made by two networks separately. In the DDPG setting, given two deterministic actors $(\\mu_{\\theta_1}, \\mu_{\\theta_2})$ with two corresponding critics $(Q_{w_1}, Q_{w_2})$, the Double Q-learning Bellman targets look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y_1 = r + \\gamma Q_{w_2}(s', \\mu_{\\theta_1}(s'))\\\\\n",
    "y_2 = r + \\gamma Q_{w_1}(s', \\mu_{\\theta_2}(s'))\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, due to the slow changing policy, these two networks could be too similar to make independent decisions. As a result, for some states we will have $Q_{w_2}(s', \\mu_{\\theta_1}(s')) > Q_{w_1}(s', \\mu_{\\theta_1}(s'))$. This is problematic because $Q_{w_1}(s', \\mu_{\\theta_1}(s'))$ will generally overestimate the true value, and in certain areas of the state space the overestimation will be further exaggerated. The *Clipped Double Q-learning* instead uses the minimum estimation among two so as to favor underestimation bias which is hard to propagate through training:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y_1 = r + \\gamma \\min_{i=1,2}Q_{w_i}(s', \\mu_{\\theta_1}(s'))\\\\\n",
    "y_2 = r + \\gamma \\min_{i=1,2} Q_{w_i}(s', \\mu_{\\theta_2}(s'))\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Delayed update of Target and Policy Networks**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the actor-critic model, policy and value updates are deeply coupled: Value estimates diverge through overestimation when the policy is poor, and the policy will become poor if the value estimate itself is inaccurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "To reduce the variance, TD3 updates the policy at a lower frequency than the Q-function. The policy network stays the same until the value error is small enough after several updates. The idea is similar to how the periodically-updated target network stay as a stable objective in DQN.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Target Policy Smoothing**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a concern with deterministic policies that they can overfit to narrow peaks in the value function. The authors propose that fitting the value of a small area around the target action:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y = r + E_\\epsilon [Q_{w'}(s', \\mu_{\\theta '}(s') + \\epsilon)],$$\n",
    "\n",
    "TD3 introduced a smoothing regularization strategy on the value function: adding a small amount of clipped random noises to the selected action and averaging over mini-batches.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y = r + \\gamma Q_{w'} (s', \\mu_{\\theta '}(s') + \\epsilon) \\\\\n",
    "\\epsilon \\sim \\text{clip}(\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma), -c, +c)  \\scriptstyle{\\text{ ; clipped random noises.}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The added noise is clipped to keep the target close tothe original action. This approach mimics the idea of SARSA update and enforces that similar actions should have similar values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the final algorithm:\n",
